This is useful in the situation that different parts of our application rely on different versions of `numpy` or some other package. This encapsulation and isolation actually allows for more efficient development of individual components of an application because the back-end of the components can be changed and upgraded independently as long as the communication lines (API calls between the components remain consistent).\n",

Isolating containers to a specific network allows us to provide singular communication lines between different parts of an application and can prevent unwanted breaches. In this case, the container we just started is our database server and we do not want people on the outside to have access to it. Try going to http://localhost:8081/ to see if you can access the database server (hint: you should get a connection error).\n",
